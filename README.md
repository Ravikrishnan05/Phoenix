# 🔌 Electricity Bill Prediction – Igniters Hackathon 2025

This repository contains my solution to the **Electricity Bill Prediction Challenge (Day 11)** of the **AI & ML Hackathon – Igniters Hackathons 2025**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Participants were tasked with building a **machine learning regression model** to predict **monthly electricity bills** based on:

- Appliance usage
- Tariff rates
- Energy provider
- Location data

The dataset includes over **45,000 records** of electricity usage across various **cities and power companies**.
